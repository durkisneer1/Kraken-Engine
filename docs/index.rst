Kraken Engine Documentation
===========================

**Kraken Engine** is a fast, lightweight 2D game framework built on top of *SDL2*. It's designed to offer just the right balance between high-level convenience and low-level control, making it ideal for both hobbyists and experienced developers.

Whether you're crafting a minimalist arcade game or building a fully-featured side-scrolling adventure, Kraken gives you the tools to develop confidently and creatively.

Overview
--------

Kraken expands upon SDL2 with a rich set of utilities tailored for game development.
It wraps common patterns into intuitive systems while keeping you close to the metal when you need to be.
Features include:

- ðŸŽ® **Unified Input System** â€“ A clean abstraction over keyboard, mouse, and controller input with support for just-pressed and just-released logic, input rebinding, and axis detection.
- ðŸ§­ **Animation Controller** â€“ Effortlessly manage sprite sheet animations with flexible frame control and transitions.
- ðŸ§± **Tile Map Support** â€“ Load and render Tiled TMX maps with support for layers, object groups, and tile flipping.
- ðŸ”Š **Audio Management** â€“ Stream music, trigger sound effects, and adjust volume levels with simple API calls.
- ðŸ§® **Math Utilities** â€“ Includes custom Vec2, easing functions, time utilities, and other game-dev math helpers.
- ðŸ§Š **Image Masking** â€“ Perform pixel-perfect collision detection using masks for precise gameplay logic.

Getting Started
---------------

If you're new to Kraken, the best place to begin is the :doc:`getting_started/installation` guide.
The engine is written in modern C++ and requires a basic understanding of the language.
Over time, the API is evolving to be even more beginner-friendly.

Planned Features
----------------

Kraken is actively growing. Upcoming additions include:

- A 2D **physics engine** with collision detection and response
- Built-in **pathfinding** (A*, grid-based nav)
- Basic **raycasting**
- A **modular UI system** (planned)
- Multiplayer/networking utilities

The goal is to offer a full development toolkit while staying simple, performant, and hackable.
