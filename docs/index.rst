Kraken Engine Docs
==================

The **Kraken Engine** is a robust extension to *SDL2*, designed to strike a balance between high- and low-level control in game development.
It supports input handling, audio management, and extra utilities like tile maps and animation controllers.

About
-----

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Kraken Engine, catering to developers with a foundational understanding of C++.
As the engine evolves, it will also become increasingly accessible to beginners, with a friendlier API and enhanced documentation.

Future of Kraken Engine
-----------------------

Planned features for the Kraken Engine include implementing essential mathematical tools like pathfinding, ray casting, and a built-in physics engine.
These additions will further expand the engine’s capabilities and make it a one-stop solution for 2D game development.

Advanced Features
-----------------

The Kraken Engine stands out with its:

- **Animation Controller Class**: A utility for managing sprite sheet animations efficiently.
- **Tile Map Class**: Simplifying the process of loading, rendering, and managing tile maps.
